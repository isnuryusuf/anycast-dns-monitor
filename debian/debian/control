Description: Anycast DNS monitor
 anycast-dns-monitor checks nameserver health by sending test queries to nominated 
 unicast addresses. The daemon can automatically bring down anycast loopback interfaces 
 if errors are encountered. This effectively removes a machine from an anycast pool as 
 BGP will automatically withdraw all routes.
